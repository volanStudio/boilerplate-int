# boilerplate-int
An early boilerplate for sass projects, with some customizations

foo


### How To
Don't have livereload or a server in here yet, but you can compile and watch with:

```
grunt
```

and simply reload that index.html file in the browser.


### Goals
Communicating that we can have a simplified process for sass organization.

```
- scss
  -- Primary elements
  -- base
  -- fonts
  -- forms
  -- etc...
    -- Application specific styles
    -- verify
      -- base
      -- education
      -- etc...
    -- underwriting
